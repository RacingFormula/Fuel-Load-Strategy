# Fuel-Load-Strategy
## Overview

The Fuel Load Strategy tool is an advanced simulation and analysis framework designed to optimise fuel load strategies for motorsport racing. By modelling factors such as fuel consumption rates, lap times, and pit stop penalties, the tool helps teams make informed decisions to balance performance and efficiency.

This tool is ideal for racing series like Formula 1 and endurance events where fuel management is a critical factor. It integrates predictive modelling with scenario analysis to improve race outcomes and strategy decisions.

## Features

- **Fuel Consumption Modelling**: Simulates fuel usage based on lap times and load.
- **Lap Time Impact Analysis**: Evaluates how fuel load affects lap performance.
- **Pit Stop Optimisation**: Determines the optimal timing for refuelling stops.
- **Scenario Analysis**: Supports multiple strategies for varying race conditions.
- **Visualisation Tools**: Provides detailed graphs of fuel usage, lap times, and race outcomes.
